    # topic.txt file
    #    contains the topic (e.g. earthquake)
    #    for which your script will need to retrieve relevant tweets
    #    via Twitter API
    #
    # You can just retrieve the most recent 100 tweets for this assignment

    # Get the topic from topic.txt


    # COMPLETE THIS PART
    # Interact with Twitter API
    # You need to retrieve (minimally)
    #    Tweet ID (e.g. 1623735160020541442)
    #    Tweet Text


    # Save tweets to a JSON file
    # e.g. earthquake.json
    


    # Please verify that your Python script works by running it stand-alone (not as part of DAG)
    # You can use Jupyter Notebook for this.
